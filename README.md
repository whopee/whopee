Hello! Let me introduce myself !👋 I'm someone who loves working with computers and making cool stuff happen. I know a bunch of tech things that can help solve problems and build websites. Here's what I'm good at:

🔍 Figuring Things Out: I'm really good at looking at numbers and turning them into useful information. For example, I made a cool "Sales Analysis Dashboard" using Power BI that helps people see how well a store is doing. 📈 It's kind of like playing with data to help businesses make better choices.

📱 Tech for School: I've already created a "Mobile Activity Blocker" app as a major project during my college days. This app addresses the issue of students using their phones during class and causing distractions. It allows students to use their phones only when the teacher permits it. 🚫📱 It's all about using technology to improve the classroom experience.

🌐 Building Websites: I love making websites that are not just pretty but also super useful. One time, I created a special website"Courses4uonly" for working professionals who wanted to learn new things. It was like building with digital LEGO blocks but on a computer! 🖥️ (Link: https://courses4uonly.000webhostapp.com/)

💼 Helping Professionals: On the web, I made a website for working people who want to learn new things. It's easy to use, and it helps them find what they need. I also know how to organize things and lead projects to get stuff done. 💬

Apart from my core skills like SQL, HTML, CSS, Python, Java, Excel, Power BI, Tableau, and more, I'm also well-versed in other computer-related areas such as databases, blogs, and even the Linux operating system.

With a skill set that includes JavaScript, Java, MySQL, and proficiency in WordPress, I also bring strong analytical and problem-solving abilities to the table. My excellent communication and collaboration skills ensure that we work seamlessly together.

So if you're interested in doing cool computer stuff together, just let me know. We can work on exciting projects and make amazing things happen! 🌟💻
